In this fast paced world when we are doing our best to engage with both our internal and external customers, are we losing track of where we are and where we want to be?  Are we trying too hard and making life difficult for ourselves?

What’s driving us to engage and embrace so many different channels and utilise so many social media channels?

Fear? I’m not a psychiatrist. And, nor have I studied anthropology (I can’t even spell anthropology without a spell checker) so these are my uneducated observations.  In my opinion, fear drives us to succeed.  It brings out the best in us and the worst; But let’s see how fear influences engagement via social media.

Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t shy away from technology; I embrace it but I don’t advocate technology for technology’s sake.  There has to be a purpose and benefits.  I’ve been an strong believer in utilising social media as a cost effective and targeted marketing medium for a long time, not necessarily from a sales-driven advertising point of view (which has its place) but more subtly in the use of case studies and providing information on what we do, to encourage discussion and engage with both internal and external customers.

Over the last decade, businesses started using social media to advertise products and services.  Then they developed and refined their approach and started to write articles and case studies, basically to advertise products and services and add the human touch, giving the reader a face and name within your company, the start of a relationship.   Then came the engagement, the reader gets to know the author and feels they can respond to the articles, ask questions and create dialogue.  By following these companies’ social media profile, the reader receives more updates and articles to read. These posts are often drafted for market research, asking for opinions on products and services. This is when advertising evolves; businesses engage with customers and widen their audience, and therefore generating more interest in their products and services.  This is where social media has the potential to perform at a much higher level than traditional advertising media, when used correctly.

Getting the message out is easy.  There are lots of tools to do this, which allow targeted messages to be broadcast across a whole raft of social media channels and to a much wider audience.  Why do we try to engage with as many different social mediums?  Fear of missing out? Fear of our competition getting one over on us?  Fear of being out of touch with the youth of today? Fear of missing out on the youth of tomorrow?

The issue with social media is most people I talk to want, and have come to expect a quick, direct and personal response.  The clue is in the name “social media”.  Before embarking on or reviving a social media campaign businesses need to make sure they have the resource to respond in a timely manner on all their chosen channels.  

I wonder if our fears of missing out are doing us more damage than good.  We see the opportunities, but is our fear of missing out clouding our judgement and our ability to analyse risk? Yes, we see our competitors forging ahead and we don’t want to be left behind, but are we looking at the risks of not being able to follow though and deliver to our customers’ expectations.  We want our customers to like, follow, and subscribe, we want them to invite us into their lives, we want their community to expand and embrace our organisation and messages.  What we don’t want is to fall short of their expectations, not deliver, because it’s not just one person that sees our failings.

It’s important to remember that social media embedded itself in the corporate arena, as we embraced it in our personal lives on our phones and tablets.  Whether the initial foray into social media was to keep in touch with friends and loved ones we don’t see as often, or to follow thought-leaders and celebrities. Many of us are addicted to various social media channels from Facebook and Twitter to YouTube and Instagram with many more in-between.  Maybe you use it to make new friends and share discussions, videos and photographs with likeminded people.

Whatever the reason you utilise social media. It seems to be here to stay. Its survival will depend on our future technological and business leaders who are still in school forming opinions and experiencing life.  It’s up to them to decide if it’s too intrusive, they will decide how and if it will be used in the future.  It’s too late for us, we are hooked.
