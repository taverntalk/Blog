There is an abundance of very useful web based collaborative apps available. Some of which are free, some initially free with paid bolt on options, others are simply a paid service that have various pricing plans to suit your business and personal needs.   Web 2.0, the Semantic Web and Web 3.0. The web is evolving to suit us, it doesn’t matter what you call it. It’s all semantics anyway.

Collaborative working has become a lot easier, and to coin a well-used phrase “Work isn’t somewhere you go, it’s something you do”.  Many people now work from home or in a remote office, displaced from their team. You can log in at the gym or like me today in a cafe. More and more of us are fortunate enough to utilise our time in a way that suits us better. We are breaking the chains and monotony of the 9-5 and escaping the rush hour commute.

We might work a little later at night, or earlier in the morning, or even during the weekend, but as long as our hours balance out at the end of the month and most importantly we get our work done, attend the meetings, in person or remotely, for many of us, it’s worth it. As an added bonus the commute is diminished, allowing us that extra time throughout the day to get something that wouldn’t otherwise be possible to do in the office.

With that in mind, you can see how collaborative working tools have become more prevalent and widely used.  Even government departments are getting in on the act.

You can sign up to a website like Freedcamp or Trello and start sharing documents, schedules and have discussions with colleagues and or clients in minutes. But what some people seem to forget is your corporate information and security policies still apply to all work information and comments you make regardless of where you make them and where they are stored.

Let’s have a quick look at the use of these project management portals with a small business in mind, like an architect’s office.  After a little research you could sign up to a service to get started, upload a few files and create a few lists, mood boards, discussion boards, as well as other tools like Gantt charts (service provider permitting) invite any of your colleagues that are working on the project and most importantly, the client. This could all be done in an hour or so, and you have a great tool at your disposal with little or no outlay and everyone that needs to contribute can do so in the one place.

This could help reduce the frequency of site visits or make site visits more productive. Your client can log on and look at schedules, and see how things are progressing, while keeping the discussion going and manage expectations.

You can see how this approach can be applied to lots of small businesses of various types, but what about the larger organisations and public bodies?

Again follow the same principle set up a project “Board” or whatever the service provider you’re subscribed to calls it, set up your initial overview, lists etc. and invite everyone that going to contribute and start sharing. This has become more prevalent as joint projects are undertaken to pull expertise and share the workload across multiple departments. It’s that simple or is it?

A major issue with these types of services is who is accountable for the safety, accessibility and integrity of the data stored there?

Many of the free service providers, as well as paid ones have various disclaimers, waivers and clauses that put the onus on the user to ensure they comply with various laws in the countries your information is accessed from, that you have ownership or permission to save and distribute the content you upload and they (the service providers) are not responsible for your information and won’t be held liable if for some reason you can’t access your information or there is a security breach. Disclaimer this is a quick summary of some of the points I picked up from reading the disclaimers when signing up to a few different service providers. I’m not saying they are all the same.

So who’s responsible?

For me whoever approved the use of these services for a body of work. In most cases the project manager or SRO should be held accountable for the security and integrity of the data. Staff and contributors do still have to take some responsibility but whether there’s a data breach, accessibility issues or loss/temporary loss of information the person that authorised the use of an online collaboration software for the project will have to take responsibility. Of course all this will have been factored in on their risk register and they will have taken steps to mitigate the effects and have a back-up plan in place. Won’t they?

What information can we save on these sites? A common response to this is anything we wouldn’t mind sharing with a journalist or publishing of social media and nothing that contains personal information, or breaches your organisations information security policies, confidential, or commercially sensitive information. Yes they are password protected, but so are free webmail accounts and social media accounts and they’ve never had security breaches…..

I don’t need to worry about information governance, freedom of information, or data protection as it’s not on our corporate system!

Wrong. Just because it’s not on the corporate system doesn’t mean to say we can ignore it. If anything we should be more cautious about what it is and where it’s stored. Any information a business generates is its responsibility, regardless of where it’s held and is subject to freedom of information, data protection and your organisations data retention and security policies.

So why are there so many free online project management tools available and why are so many people and organisations using them?

Doing more with less, reduction of office space and encouraging staff to either work from home full time or for x number of days a week. In the case of larger organisations and government the use of satellite offices and commuter hubs means we have a more dispersed workforce, and they need to communicate and work with each other as well as external partners regardless of where they are or what type of connection they have.

Would I use something like Trello?

Yes. I use Freedcamp for personal use and organising non work events and the likes. Would I use them for work? I’d prefer something hosted by work, but I have started to use it just as a checklist for outstanding jobs so I can share with the team and keep an eye on progress of tasks from my mobile when I’m out of the office for a few days. I wouldn’t rely on it and it does add slightly to the admin just to enable me to see what’s happening when I’m not in the office. I also use it to manage ideas for articles and I find the cards useful for organising thoughts and structure.                                                                                                        

It’s quick and easy to get set up and share information using something like Trello rather than utilising your IT department, filling out forms and having multiple discussions about what you want, why you want it, what it’s being used for, and who is going to use it. Then you have to look at it from an information security point of view. What type of information is stored there? how long for? Who else will have access to the information?  Are there any legal issues with the location of the service providers servers? and the information that’s being stored? Then on top of that you have the; what budgets available?  Does it represent value for money? It’s easy to see why people opt to use these services, rather than using an in-house alternative.

There is a battle of wills going on between those that want things to be simple, quick and painless to set up and use, and those that are there to protect the business and you.

I may be considered too security cautious, but I think it’s a slippery slope and before you know it, more and more data will be inappropriately stored on servers which your business has no control over and they can’t guarantee the security and integrity of the data stored there.  What are your thoughts? Do you use online collaboration tools? If so which ones? And is it for personal or business use?
