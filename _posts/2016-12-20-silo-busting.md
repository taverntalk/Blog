# Silo busting. A pipe dream or realistic aspiration?”

So after thinking and writing about online project management and collaboration apps in Freed from our Shackles, I started to ponder on the projects I’ve been involved in. I recalled the almost regular organisational pushes for silo busting and chuckled to myself.

## Should we face facts and accept we were never truly silo busting?

Were we simply breaking into others silos and building new ones? As the hot-desking ninja can attest to we now spend our time hopping between silos as we move from desk to desk with little or no interaction with the colleagues around us who have no bearing in our little spheres of work. Are we becoming silo nomads? #silonomad

## The End of the ‘Office’

Many of us work on numerous projects. Each one self-encapsulated. On top of this, we ourselves are becoming more insular and nomadic. Job roles are changing, office space is changing. Rows of desks with computers are becoming a thing of the past. Replaced with quiet areas, privacy pods and the people are gone. You should be able to see tumble weed moving though the offices, but the cleaning staff are the highest attending employees / contractors. Busy offices are fast becoming ghost ships, silently steering through the turmoil and haze of daily life.  

Are we regressing to our basic hunter gatherer instincts? Or are we kidding ourselves for thinking we ever lost them? We hunt and forage for information to help us work more productively and jealously guard our secrets as we move from project to project, employer to employer. So the real question is, can we truly put and end to silo working and is there an appetite for it?  

## ‘Opening’ Up the Silos

There are many good examples within the IT and open source community and the one that springs to mind for me is GIT Hub. But it’s not just community led projects, big business is getting in on the act. Microsoft is digging deep and developing partnerships in the open source community. They recently announced at their Connect() Conference that they became a Platinum member of the Linux Foundation. OpenAI has agreed to partner with Microsoft to develop "cloud brains" to test its experiments.  

The UK Government is also working hard to make better use of the data it holds to make it more accessible to others through their Open Data Strategy.

## Working Out Loud

At an individual level we can all make it easier for others to contribute, and share the knowledge and data we are storing away. Mid-November saw [National Working out Loud Week](https://wolweek.com/) and is something Addeel Khan, Head of Internal Communications and Engagement, championed within the Food Standards Agency. It’s about being open about what we are doing, asking for ideas and inspiration, finding out if similar projects are being carried out and learning from what has been done in the past as we’re moving into the future.

## Lowering the Walls

Maybe silo busting isn’t unachievable. But by taking the roof off and lowering the walls, the silos could look more like fields segmented with dry stone walls dotted with stiles to climb over and gateways to walk through. In this picture there are no silos.

Some of the tools we use are great for collaborating within the team, but how do we draw in more interest and share our experiences with others? How do we learn from what others have done on similar projects?  

The appetite is there for a more open, silo free world. We just have to be careful how we approach it.
